# ascelerate — A Swift CLI for App Store Connect

A command-line tool for building, archiving, and publishing apps to the App Store — from Xcode archive to App Review submission. Built with Swift on the [App Store Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi).

> **Note:** Covers the core app release workflow: archiving, uploading builds, managing versions and localizations, screenshots, review submission, provisioning (devices, certificates, bundle IDs, profiles), and full management of in-app purchases and subscriptions. Also handles customer reviews and developer responses, in-app events, custom product pages, and Sales/Finance/Analytics report downloads. Most provisioning commands support interactive mode — run without arguments to get guided prompts.

> **Full documentation:** [ascelerate.dev](https://ascelerate.dev)

## Requirements

- macOS 13+
- Swift 6.0+ (only for building from source)

## Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap keremerkan/tap
brew trust keremerkan/tap
brew install ascelerate
```

Since Homebrew 6.0, third-party taps must be explicitly trusted before their code runs. The `brew trust` step above approves the tap; alternatively, a fully-qualified install (`brew install keremerkan/tap/ascelerate`) prompts you to trust it interactively.

The tap provides a pre-built binary for Apple Silicon Macs, so installation is instant.

### Install script

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keremerkan/ascelerate/main/install.sh | bash
```

Downloads the latest release, installs to `/usr/local/bin`, and removes the quarantine attribute automatically. Apple Silicon only.

### Download manually

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/keremerkan/ascelerate/releases):

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/keremerkan/ascelerate/releases/latest/download/ascelerate-macos-arm64.tar.gz -o ascelerate.tar.gz
tar xzf ascelerate.tar.gz
mv ascelerate /usr/local/bin/
```

Since the binary is not signed or notarized, macOS will quarantine it on first download. Remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/ascelerate
```

> **Note:** Pre-built binaries are provided for Apple Silicon (arm64) only. Intel Mac users should build from source.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keremerkan/ascelerate.git
cd ascelerate
swift build -c release
strip .build/release/ascelerate
cp .build/release/ascelerate /usr/local/bin/
```

> **Note:** The release build takes a few minutes because the [asc-swift](https://github.com/aaronsky/asc-swift) dependency includes ~2500 generated source files covering the entire App Store Connect API surface. `strip` removes debug symbols, reducing the binary from ~175 MB to ~59 MB.

### Shell completions

Set up tab completion for subcommands, options, and flags (supports zsh and bash):

```bash
ascelerate install-completions
```

This detects your shell and configures everything automatically. Restart your shell or open a new tab to activate.

### AI coding skill

ascelerate ships with a skill file that gives AI coding agents (Claude Code, Grok Build, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot) full knowledge of all commands, JSON formats, and workflows.

**Via the binary** (detects your installed agents):

```bash
ascelerate install-skill          # install/update for every detected agent
ascelerate install-skill --all    # include all supported agents (e.g. Copilot)
```

It auto-detects Claude Code, Grok Build (which reads the Claude Code skill path natively), Cursor, and Windsurf (and GitHub Copilot with `--all`), installs/updates the skill for each, and checks for outdated skills on each run to prompt you after upgrades.

**Via npx** (any AI coding agent):

```bash
npx ascelerate-skill
```

This presents an interactive menu to select your agent and installs the skill to the appropriate directory. The skill file is fetched from GitHub, so it's always up to date. Use `npx ascelerate-skill --uninstall` to remove it.

## Setup

### 1. Create an API Key

Go to [App Store Connect > Users and Access > Integrations > App Store Connect API](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api) and generate a new key. Download the `.p8` private key file.

### 2. Configure

```bash
ascelerate configure
```

This will prompt for your **Key ID**, **Issuer ID**, and the path to your `.p8` file, plus an optional **vendor number** (only needed for `reports sales`/`reports finance`). The private key is copied into `~/.ascelerate/` with strict file permissions (owner-only access).

## Usage

### Aliases

Instead of typing full bundle IDs every time, you can create short aliases:

```bash
# Add an alias (interactive app picker)
ascelerate alias add myapp

# Now use the alias anywhere you'd use a bundle ID
ascelerate apps info myapp
ascelerate apps versions myapp
ascelerate apps localizations view myapp

# List all aliases
ascelerate alias list

# Remove an alias
ascelerate alias remove myapp
```

Aliases are stored in `~/.ascelerate/aliases.json`. Any argument that doesn't contain a dot is looked up as an alias — real bundle IDs (which always contain dots) work unchanged.

### JSON output

Read commands support `--json` for machine-readable output, ready for `jq`, scripts, and AI agents:

```bash
ascelerate apps list --json
ascelerate apps info <bundle-id> --json
ascelerate apps versions <bundle-id> --json
ascelerate apps review preflight <bundle-id> --json
ascelerate apps review status <bundle-id> --json
ascelerate builds list --bundle-id <bundle-id> --json
ascelerate testflight builds <bundle-id> --json
ascelerate testflight status <bundle-id> --json
ascelerate reviews list <bundle-id> --json
ascelerate reviews info <review-id> --json
ascelerate iap list <bundle-id> --json
ascelerate iap info <bundle-id> <product-id> --json
ascelerate iap pricing show <bundle-id> <product-id> --json
ascelerate sub groups <bundle-id> --json
ascelerate sub list <bundle-id> --json
ascelerate sub info <bundle-id> <product-id> --json
ascelerate sub pricing show <bundle-id> <product-id> --json
ascelerate rate-limit --json
```

List commands emit a top-level JSON array, detail commands a single object. Enum values are raw API constants (`WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`, `IOS`), dates are ISO 8601, every resource carries its `id`, null fields are omitted, and empty results emit `[]` — never prose. Warnings become booleans (`iap info`/`sub info` report `"hasPricing": false`). `--json` implies non-interactive mode, and errors go to stderr so stdout is always valid JSON.

### Apps

```bash
# List all apps
ascelerate apps list

# Show app details
ascelerate apps info <bundle-id>

# List App Store versions
ascelerate apps versions <bundle-id>

# Create a new version
ascelerate apps create-version <bundle-id> <version-string>
ascelerate apps create-version <bundle-id> 2.1.0 --platform ios --release-type manual

# View or update the copyright notice
ascelerate apps copyright <bundle-id>
ascelerate apps copyright <bundle-id> --set "2026 Your Name" --version 2.1.0 --platform macos

# Check review submission status
ascelerate apps review status <bundle-id>
ascelerate apps review status <bundle-id> --version 2.1.0

# Submit for review
ascelerate apps review submit <bundle-id>
ascelerate apps review submit <bundle-id> --version 2.1.0
ascelerate apps review submit <bundle-id> --platform macos

# Resolve rejected review items (after fixing issues and replying in Resolution Center)
ascelerate apps review resolve-issues <bundle-id>

# Cancel an active review submission
ascelerate apps review cancel-submission <bundle-id>

# View or update App Review Information (contact, demo account, notes)
ascelerate apps review info <bundle-id>
ascelerate apps review info <bundle-id> --contact-email you@example.com --demo-account-name reviewer --demo-account-password "hunter2" --demo-account-required true --notes "Steps to test…"

# App Review attachment files (demo videos, docs, etc.)
ascelerate apps review attachment list <bundle-id>
ascelerate apps review attachment upload <bundle-id> demo.mp4
ascelerate apps review attachment delete <attachment-id>
```

For universal-purchase apps (one App Store record spanning iOS, macOS, tvOS, and/or visionOS), the same version string can exist once per platform. `create-version` and `review submit` default to iOS — pass `--platform macos` (or `tvos`, `visionos`) to target another platform. All other version-scoped commands (localizations, media, build attach, review preflight/info/attachments/resolve-issues/cancel-submission, phased release, release, routing coverage) accept an optional `--platform` as well; without it they prompt whenever a version (or active review submission) matches more than one platform — and refuse with a hint instead of prompting under `--yes`.

#### Pre-submission preflight checks

Before submitting for review, run `preflight` to verify that all required fields are filled in across every locale:

```bash
# Check the latest editable version
ascelerate apps review preflight <bundle-id>

# Check a specific version
ascelerate apps review preflight <bundle-id> --version 2.1.0
```

The command checks version state, build attachment, and then goes through each locale to verify localization fields (description, what's new, keywords, support URL), app info fields (name, subtitle, privacy policy URL), and screenshots. Results are grouped by locale with colored pass/fail indicators:

```
Preflight checks for MyApp v2.1.0 (Prepare for Submission)

Check                                Status
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Version state                        ✓ Prepare for Submission
Build attached                       ✓ Build 42

en-US (English (United States))
  App info                           ✓ All fields filled
  Localizations                      ✓ All fields filled
  Screenshots                        ✓ 2 sets, 10 screenshots

de-DE (German (Germany))
  App info                           ✗ Missing: Privacy Policy URL
  Localizations                      ✗ Missing: What's New
  Screenshots                        ✗ No screenshots
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Result: 5 passed, 3 failed
```

The What's New check is skipped when the app has no previously released version — that field only exists for updates, not for a first release.

Exits with a non-zero status when any check fails, making it suitable for CI pipelines and workflow files. With `--json`, it emits a structured report — a `passed` boolean plus one entry per check — while keeping the same exit-code behavior.

### Build Management

```bash
# Interactively select and attach a build to a version
ascelerate apps build attach <bundle-id>
ascelerate apps build attach <bundle-id> --version 2.1.0

# Attach the most recent build automatically
ascelerate apps build attach-latest <bundle-id>
ascelerate apps build attach-latest <bundle-id> --platform macos

# Remove the attached build from a version
ascelerate apps build detach <bundle-id>
```

Build lookups are platform-aware: on universal-purchase apps, iOS and macOS builds can share build numbers, so the attach commands only consider builds matching the target version's platform.

### Phased Release

```bash
# View phased release status
ascelerate apps phased-release <bundle-id>

# Enable phased release (starts inactive, activates when version goes live)
ascelerate apps phased-release <bundle-id> --enable

# Pause, resume, or complete a phased release
ascelerate apps phased-release <bundle-id> --pause
ascelerate apps phased-release <bundle-id> --resume
ascelerate apps phased-release <bundle-id> --complete

# Remove phased release entirely
ascelerate apps phased-release <bundle-id> --disable
```

### Manual Release

When a version's release option is set to manual, the approved version sits in Pending Developer Release until you release it:

```bash
# Release the version that is pending developer release
ascelerate apps release <bundle-id>

# Target a specific version or platform
ascelerate apps release <bundle-id> --version 2.1.0 --platform macos
```

### Age Rating

```bash
# View age rating declaration
ascelerate apps app-info age-rating <bundle-id>

# Export age rating to JSON
ascelerate apps app-info age-rating export <bundle-id>

# Update age ratings from a JSON file
ascelerate apps app-info age-rating import <bundle-id> --file age-rating.json
```

The JSON file uses the same field names as the API. Only fields present in the file are updated:

```json
{
  "isAdvertising": false,
  "isUserGeneratedContent": true,
  "violenceCartoonOrFantasy": "INFREQUENT_OR_MILD",
  "alcoholTobaccoOrDrugUseOrReferences": "NONE"
}
```

Intensity fields accept: `NONE`, `INFREQUENT_OR_MILD`, `FREQUENT_OR_INTENSE`. Boolean fields accept `true`/`false`.

### Routing App Coverage

```bash
# View current routing coverage status
ascelerate apps routing-coverage <bundle-id>

# Upload a .geojson file
ascelerate apps routing-coverage <bundle-id> --file coverage.geojson
```

### Localizations

```bash
# View localizations (latest version by default)
ascelerate apps localizations view <bundle-id>
ascelerate apps localizations view <bundle-id> --version 2.1.0 --locale en-US

# Export localizations to JSON
ascelerate apps localizations export <bundle-id>
ascelerate apps localizations export <bundle-id> --version 2.1.0 --output my-localizations.json

# Update a single locale
ascelerate apps localizations update <bundle-id> --whats-new "Bug fixes" --locale en-US

# Bulk update from JSON file
ascelerate apps localizations import <bundle-id> --file localizations.json
```

The JSON format for export and bulk update:

```json
{
  "en-US": {
    "description": "My app description.\n\nSecond paragraph.",
    "whatsNew": "- Bug fixes\n- New dark mode",
    "keywords": "productivity,tools,utility",
    "promotionalText": "Try our new features!",
    "marketingURL": "https://example.com",
    "supportURL": "https://example.com/support"
  },
  "de-DE": {
    "whatsNew": "- Fehlerbehebungen\n- Neuer Dunkelmodus"
  }
}
```

Only fields present in the JSON are updated -- omitted fields are left unchanged.

### Screenshots & App Previews

```bash
# Download all screenshots and preview videos
ascelerate apps media download <bundle-id>
ascelerate apps media download <bundle-id> --folder my-media/ --version 2.1.0

# Upload screenshots and preview videos from a folder
ascelerate apps media upload <bundle-id> media/

# Upload from an archive (zip, tar, tar.gz supported)
ascelerate apps media upload <bundle-id> screenshots.zip

# Upload to a specific version
ascelerate apps media upload <bundle-id> media/ --version 2.1.0

# Replace existing media in matching sets before uploading
ascelerate apps media upload <bundle-id> media/ --replace

# Interactive mode: pick a folder or archive from the current directory
ascelerate apps media upload <bundle-id>
```

When the folder argument is omitted, the command lists all subdirectories and archive files in the current directory as a numbered picker. Archives (zip, tar, tar.gz) are extracted automatically before upload.

Organize your media folder with locale and display type subfolders:

```
media/
├── en-US/
│   ├── APP_IPHONE_67/
│   │   ├── 01_home.png
│   │   ├── 02_settings.png
│   │   └── preview.mp4
│   └── APP_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129/
│       └── 01_home.png
└── de-DE/
    └── APP_IPHONE_67/
        ├── 01_home.png
        └── 02_settings.png
```

- **Level 1:** Locale (e.g. `en-US`, `de-DE`, `ja`)
- **Level 2:** Display type folder name (see table below)
- **Level 3:** Media files -- images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`) become screenshots, videos (`.mp4`, `.mov`) become app previews
- Files are uploaded in alphabetical order by filename
- Unsupported files are skipped with a warning

> **Note:** Watch and iMessage display types support screenshots only -- video files in those folders are skipped with a warning. The `--replace` flag deletes all existing assets in each matching set before uploading new ones.
>
> `media download` saves files in this same folder structure (defaults to `<bundle-id>-media/`), so you can download, edit, and re-upload.

#### Using with app-store-screenshots

[app-store-screenshots](https://github.com/keremerkan/ascelerate/tree/main/skills/app-store-screenshots) is a companion skill for AI coding agents that generates production-ready App Store screenshots. It creates a Next.js page that renders ad-style marketing layouts using framed device screenshots from `ascelerate screenshot frame` and exports them as a zip file ready for upload via `ascelerate apps media upload`:

```
en-US/APP_IPHONE_67/01_hero.png
en-US/APP_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129/01_hero.png
de-DE/APP_IPHONE_67/01_hero.png
```

Install the skill for your AI coding agent:

```bash
npx skills add keremerkan/ascelerate
```

Upload the exported zip directly:

```bash
ascelerate apps media upload <bundle-id> screenshots.zip --replace
```

#### Verify and retry stuck media

Sometimes screenshots or previews get stuck in "processing" after upload. Use `media verify` to check the status of all media at once and optionally retry stuck items:

```bash
# Check status of all screenshots and previews
ascelerate apps media verify <bundle-id>

# Check a specific version
ascelerate apps media verify <bundle-id> --version 2.1.0

# Retry stuck items using local files from the media folder
ascelerate apps media verify <bundle-id> media/
```

Without `--folder`, the command shows a read-only status report. Sets where all items are complete show a compact one-liner; sets with stuck items expand to show each file and its state. With `--folder`, it prompts to retry stuck items by deleting them and re-uploading from the matching local files, preserving the original position order.

#### Prune stale sets

`--replace` on upload only clears sets that match a local folder — server sets for screen sizes you no longer ship (say, an old 5.8-inch set) keep their outdated screenshots. `media prune` deletes the sets that have no matching local locale/display-type folder, after listing them with asset counts and confirming:

```bash
ascelerate apps media prune <bundle-id> media/
ascelerate apps media prune <bundle-id> media/ --version 2.1.0 --platform ios
```

Locales that have no local folder at all are skipped entirely — the command only prunes within locales the folder actually manages.

### Capturing Screenshots

Capture App Store screenshots directly from iOS/iPadOS simulators using UI tests. Replaces [fastlane snapshot](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/snapshot/).

```bash
# Generate config and helper files
ascelerate screenshot init                        # Creates ascelerate/screenshot.yml and ascelerate/ScreenshotHelper.swift

# Capture screenshots
ascelerate screenshot run
ascelerate screenshot run -l en-US,tr-TR          # Only capture a subset of configured languages
ascelerate screenshot frame                       # Frame screenshots with device bezels
ascelerate screenshot doctor                      # Check config and environment for problems
```

Add `ScreenshotHelper.swift` to your UITest target, then call `setupScreenshots(app)` in `setUp()` and `screenshot("name")` to capture:

```swift
override func setUp() {
    setupScreenshots(app)
    app.launch()
}

func testScreenshots() {
    screenshot("01-home")
    app.buttons["Settings"].tap()
    screenshot("02-settings")
}
```

Configure via `ascelerate/screenshot.yml`:

```yaml
# workspace: MyApp.xcworkspace
project: MyApp.xcodeproj
scheme: AppUITests
devices:
  - simulator: iPhone 17 Pro Max
    # frameDevice: true
    # deviceBezel: ./bezels/iPhone 17 Pro Max.png
  - simulator: iPad Pro 13-inch (M5)
    # frameDevice: true
    # deviceBezel: ./bezels/iPad Pro 13-inch (M5).png
languages:
  - en-US
  - de-DE
outputDirectory: ./screenshots
# framedOutputDirectory: ./screenshots/framed
clearPreviousScreenshots: true
localizeSimulator: true
overrideStatusBar: true
# darkMode: false
# disableAnimations: false
# waitAfterBoot: 0
# configuration: Debug
# testplan: MyTestPlan
# numberOfRetries: 0                    # Retry failed languages (erase + reboot simulator)
# stopAfterFirstError: false
# reinstallApp: false
# disableAssetDownloads: false          # Disable mobileassetd (no Siri/keyboard/ML asset downloads; also blocks on-device ML assets)
# xcargs: -maximum-parallel-testing-workers 2
```

Features:
- Builds once, then runs tests across all languages
- iPhone and iPad run concurrently per language
- Status bar override (9:41, full bars, no carrier)
- Simulator localization per language
- Dark mode support
- Animation disabling for reliable captures
- Automatic retries for failed languages (erases simulator, re-localizes, reboots, and reruns)
- Errors skip and continue, with summary table and error logs saved to output
- Helper version tracking with update warnings
- Device bezel framing with [Apple Product Bezels](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/#product-bezels) (download required)
- Config validation via `doctor` subcommand
- `create-helper` available separately but also run automatically by `init`

Output structure:
```
screenshots/
├── en-US/
│   ├── iPhone-01-home.png
│   └── iPad-01-home.png
└── de-DE/
    └── ...
```

With `frameDevice` enabled, framed screenshots are saved to `{outputDirectory}/framed/` (or `framedOutputDirectory` if set).

The grace period lets subscribers keep access for a short window after a failed renewal payment while Apple retries billing. Settings apply to the whole app.

```bash
# View current grace period configuration
ascelerate apps subscription-grace-period <bundle-id>

# Enable for production with a 16-day window, applies to all renewals
ascelerate apps subscription-grace-period <bundle-id> --opt-in true --duration SIXTEEN_DAYS --renewal-type ALL_RENEWALS

# Enable for sandbox testing too
ascelerate apps subscription-grace-period <bundle-id> --sandbox-opt-in true
```

Valid `--duration` values: `THREE_DAYS`, `SIXTEEN_DAYS`, `TWENTY_EIGHT_DAYS`. Valid `--renewal-type` values: `ALL_RENEWALS`, `PAID_TO_PAID_ONLY`.

### Devices

```bash
# List registered devices
ascelerate devices list
ascelerate devices list --platform IOS --status ENABLED

# Show device details (interactive picker if name/UDID omitted)
ascelerate devices info
ascelerate devices info "My iPhone"

# Register a new device (interactive prompts if options omitted)
ascelerate devices register
ascelerate devices register --name "My iPhone" --udid 00008101-XXXXXXXXXXXX --platform IOS

# Update a device (interactive picker and update prompts if omitted)
ascelerate devices update
ascelerate devices update "My iPhone" --name "Work iPhone"
ascelerate devices update "My iPhone" --status DISABLED
```

### Certificates

```bash
# List signing certificates
ascelerate certs list
ascelerate certs list --type DISTRIBUTION

# Show certificate details (interactive picker if omitted)
ascelerate certs info
ascelerate certs info "Apple Distribution: Example Inc"

# Create a certificate (interactive type picker if --type omitted)
# Auto-generates RSA key pair and CSR, imports into login keychain
ascelerate certs create
ascelerate certs create --type DISTRIBUTION
ascelerate certs create --type DEVELOPMENT --csr my-request.pem

# Revoke a certificate (interactive picker if omitted)
ascelerate certs revoke
ascelerate certs revoke ABC123DEF456
```

### Bundle Identifiers

```bash
# List bundle identifiers
ascelerate bundle-ids list
ascelerate bundle-ids list --platform IOS

# Show details and capabilities (interactive picker if omitted)
ascelerate bundle-ids info
ascelerate bundle-ids info com.example.MyApp

# Register a new bundle ID (interactive prompts if options omitted)
ascelerate bundle-ids register
ascelerate bundle-ids register --name "My App" --identifier com.example.MyApp --platform IOS

# Rename a bundle ID (identifier itself is immutable)
ascelerate bundle-ids update
ascelerate bundle-ids update com.example.MyApp --name "My Renamed App"

# Delete a bundle ID (interactive picker if omitted)
ascelerate bundle-ids delete
ascelerate bundle-ids delete com.example.MyApp

# Enable a capability (interactive pickers if omitted)
# Shows only capabilities not already enabled
ascelerate bundle-ids enable-capability
ascelerate bundle-ids enable-capability com.example.MyApp --type PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS

# Disable a capability (picks from currently enabled capabilities)
ascelerate bundle-ids disable-capability
ascelerate bundle-ids disable-capability com.example.MyApp
```

After enabling or disabling a capability, if provisioning profiles exist for that bundle ID, the command offers to regenerate them (required for changes to take effect).

> **Note:** Some capabilities (e.g. App Groups, iCloud, Associated Domains) require additional configuration in the [Apple Developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources) after enabling.

### Provisioning Profiles

```bash
# List provisioning profiles
ascelerate profiles list
ascelerate profiles list --type IOS_APP_STORE --state ACTIVE

# Show profile details (interactive picker if omitted)
ascelerate profiles info
ascelerate profiles info "My App Store Profile"

# Download a profile (interactive picker if omitted)
ascelerate profiles download
ascelerate profiles download "My App Store Profile" --output ./profiles/

# Create a profile (fully interactive if options omitted)
# Prompts for name, type, bundle ID, certificates, and devices
ascelerate profiles create
ascelerate profiles create --name "My Profile" --type IOS_APP_STORE --bundle-id com.example.MyApp --certificates all

# --certificates all uses all certs of the matching family (distribution, development, or Developer ID)
# You can also specify serial numbers: --certificates ABC123,DEF456

# Delete a profile (interactive picker if omitted)
ascelerate profiles delete
ascelerate profiles delete "My App Store Profile"

# Reissue profiles (delete + recreate with latest certs of matching family)
ascelerate profiles reissue                         # Interactive: pick from all profiles (shows status)
ascelerate profiles reissue "My Profile"            # Reissue a specific profile by name
ascelerate profiles reissue --all-invalid           # Reissue all invalid profiles
ascelerate profiles reissue --all                   # Reissue all profiles regardless of state
ascelerate profiles reissue --all --all-devices     # Reissue all, using all enabled devices for dev/adhoc
ascelerate profiles reissue --all --to-certs ABC123,DEF456  # Use specific certificates instead of auto-detect
```

### Builds

```bash
# List all builds (shows app version, platform, and build number)
ascelerate builds list
ascelerate builds list --bundle-id <bundle-id>
ascelerate builds list --bundle-id <bundle-id> --version 2.1.0
ascelerate builds list --bundle-id <bundle-id> --platform macos

# Archive an Xcode project
ascelerate builds archive
ascelerate builds archive --scheme MyApp --output ./archives

# Validate a build before uploading
ascelerate builds validate MyApp.ipa

# Upload a build to App Store Connect
ascelerate builds upload MyApp.ipa

# Wait for a build to finish processing
ascelerate builds await-processing <bundle-id>
ascelerate builds await-processing <bundle-id> --build-version 903
ascelerate builds await-processing <bundle-id> --build-version 903 --platform macos
```

The `archive` command auto-detects the `.xcworkspace` or `.xcodeproj` in the current directory and resolves the scheme if only one exists. It accepts `.ipa`, `.pkg`, or `.xcarchive` files for `upload` and `validate`. When given an `.xcarchive`, it detects the archive's platform and automatically exports to `.ipa` (iOS-family) or `.pkg` (macOS) before uploading, passing the matching platform to altool.

### TestFlight

```bash
# Beta groups
ascelerate testflight groups list <bundle-id>
ascelerate testflight groups info <bundle-id> "External Testers"
ascelerate testflight groups create <bundle-id> --name "Friends" --public-link --public-link-limit 100
ascelerate testflight groups update <bundle-id> "Friends" --public-link false
ascelerate testflight groups delete <bundle-id> "Friends"

# Give a group access to a build (defaults to the latest)
ascelerate testflight groups add-build <bundle-id> "Friends"
ascelerate testflight groups add-build <bundle-id> "Friends" --build 123
ascelerate testflight groups remove-build <bundle-id> "Friends" --build 123

# Public-link recruitment criteria (device/OS filters)

ascelerate testflight review-info <bundle-id>            # contact + demo account; pass flags to update
ascelerate testflight eula <bundle-id> --file eula.txt   # custom beta license agreement

# Tester feedback
ascelerate testflight feedback crashes list <bundle-id>
ascelerate testflight feedback crashes log <submission-id> --output crash.log
ascelerate testflight feedback screenshots list <bundle-id>
ascelerate testflight feedback screenshots download <bundle-id>    # picker; zips screenshots + comment
```

Build-scoped commands default to the latest non-expired build; pass `--build <number>` (and `--platform` for universal-purchase apps) to target a specific one. `testers import` reads one tester per line (`email[,first name[,last name]]`), skipping blank lines, `#` comments, and a leading header row.

Filter values are case-insensitive. Types: `CONSUMABLE`, `NON_CONSUMABLE`, `NON_RENEWING_SUBSCRIPTION`. States: `APPROVED`, `MISSING_METADATA`, `READY_TO_SUBMIT`, `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`, `IN_REVIEW`, etc.

`iap info` and `iap pricing show` warn when an IAP has no price schedule — the same condition surfaced in `apps review preflight`. When `set` changes the base territory price, existing per-territory manual overrides are preserved by default. If overrides exist, an interactive menu offers to revert any of them; pass `--remove-all-overrides` for a non-interactive wipe.

`iap pricing export` writes the base territory and every manual price to a JSON file keyed by territory code; `iap pricing import` applies such a file to any IAP — prices are matched to the target product's own tiers by customer price, so the file works across products and apps. Import replaces the schedule wholesale: territories not listed in the file revert to auto-equalize. If the current schedule already matches the file, import is a no-op.

Offer code one-time-use codes are generated asynchronously. After `gen-codes`, run `view-codes <batch-id>` to fetch the actual code values. If the response is empty, retry in a few seconds. Custom codes (`add-custom-codes`) are developer-supplied strings that don't need separate generation.

Images and review screenshots use Apple's 3-step file upload flow (reserve → PUT chunks → commit with MD5). The CLI handles all three steps in `upload`.

When submitting an app version for review, `apps review submit` automatically detects IAPs and subscriptions with pending changes and offers to submit them alongside the app version. Pending changes are read from each product's version history (a version in Prepare for Submission, Ready for Review, or a rejected state), so screenshot-only edits are detected too. The same check drives `iap submit`, `sub submit`, and `sub submit-group`: any product with a pending version can be submitted, including approved products with edits since their last approval, and without one the command stops before making any request. `iap info` and `sub info` show the pending version, and `apps review status` resolves the items of active submissions to the app version or product they refer to.

The localization import commands create missing locales automatically with confirmation, so you can add new languages without visiting App Store Connect.

`sub intro-offer` is for new subscribers (free trials and intro discounts). `sub promo-offer` is for existing subscribers (requires server-side signing of the offer payload at runtime). `sub offer-code` produces redeemable code campaigns — one-time-use batches generate asynchronously (use `view-codes <batch-id>` to fetch values), while custom codes are developer-supplied strings.

Images and review screenshots use Apple's 3-step upload flow (reserve → PUT chunks → commit with MD5) — `upload` handles all three steps.

**Win-back offers** are intentionally not yet implemented because asc-swift's generated `WinBackOfferPriceInlineCreate` is missing the territory and price-point relationships the API requires. Will revisit once the dependency is updated.

Subscription pricing is per-territory. There is no auto-equalize concept like IAPs have, so `--equalize-all-territories` mirrors what the App Store Connect web UI does behind the scenes: looks up the equivalent local-currency tier in every territory and POSTs one price record per territory.

Apple treats price changes differently for existing subscribers depending on direction — `sub pricing set` enforces this:

- **Decrease**: existing subscribers automatically move to the lower price. Interactive runs prompt; `--yes` mode requires `--confirm-decrease` to acknowledge the revenue impact.
- **Increase**: you must explicitly choose how to handle existing subscribers. Errors unless `--preserve-current` (grandfather them at the old price) or `--no-preserve-current` (push them to the new price after Apple's notification period) is set. Same rule applies aggregated across `--equalize-all-territories`.
- **New territory** (no existing price): no existing subscribers to consider; flags optional.
- **Unchanged**: skipped silently.

`sub pricing export` writes every territory's current customer price to a JSON file (preserved/grandfathered and future-scheduled prices are excluded); `sub pricing import` applies such a file to any subscription — prices are matched to the target subscription's own tiers by customer price, so the file works across products and apps. Import only touches listed territories, skips ones already at the listed price, and enforces the same increase/decrease safety rules as `sub pricing set`.

Multi-territory price writes retry transient App Store Connect errors (HTTP 429/5xx) automatically — first in place with backoff, then in a second sweep at the end of the run. Territories that still fail are listed in the final report and the command exits non-zero; re-running the same command retries just those, since already-updated territories are skipped as unchanged.

### Customer Reviews

```bash
# List reviews (newest first by default)
ascelerate reviews list <bundle-id>
ascelerate reviews list <bundle-id> --rating 1 --sort critical --unanswered --limit 20
ascelerate reviews list <bundle-id> --territory USA

# Full review text + developer response
ascelerate reviews info <review-id>

# Publish (or replace) a developer response
ascelerate reviews respond <review-id> --body "Thanks for the feedback! ..."

# Delete the developer response
ascelerate reviews delete-response <review-id>
```

Reviews are read-only — you can only manage the developer response. `--sort` accepts `recent`, `oldest`, `critical` (lowest rating first), or `best`. Review IDs come from `reviews list`. With `--json`, `reviews list` includes full review bodies and developer responses, so no per-review `info` calls are needed.

### In-App Events

```bash
# List and inspect
ascelerate events list <bundle-id>
ascelerate events list <bundle-id> --state PUBLISHED
ascelerate events info <bundle-id> <reference-name-or-id>

# Create, update, delete (events are referenced by name or ID)
ascelerate events create <bundle-id> --reference-name "summer-sale" --badge SPECIAL_EVENT --purpose ATTRACT_NEW_USERS --priority HIGH
ascelerate events create <bundle-id> --reference-name "launch" --territories USA,GBR --publish-start 2026-07-01 --event-start 2026-07-05 --event-end 2026-07-12
ascelerate events update <bundle-id> summer-sale --priority NORMAL --badge NONE
ascelerate events delete <bundle-id> summer-sale

# Localizations (name, short description, long description per locale)
ascelerate events localizations view <bundle-id> summer-sale
ascelerate events localizations export <bundle-id> summer-sale
ascelerate events localizations import <bundle-id> summer-sale --file event-locales.json

# Media — event card / details page screenshots and video clips
ascelerate events media list <bundle-id> summer-sale
ascelerate events media upload <bundle-id> summer-sale --locale en-US --asset-type EVENT_CARD card.png
ascelerate events media upload <bundle-id> summer-sale --locale en-US --asset-type EVENT_DETAILS_PAGE clip.mp4 --preview-frame 00:00:03
ascelerate events media delete <bundle-id> summer-sale <media-id>
```

Badges: `LIVE_EVENT`, `PREMIERE`, `CHALLENGE`, `COMPETITION`, `NEW_SEASON`, `MAJOR_UPDATE`, `SPECIAL_EVENT`. Purposes: `APPROPRIATE_FOR_ALL_USERS`, `ATTRACT_NEW_USERS`, `KEEP_ACTIVE_USERS_INFORMED`, `BRING_BACK_LAPSED_USERS`. Schedule dates accept ISO8601 or `yyyy-MM-dd`. Asset types: `EVENT_CARD`, `EVENT_DETAILS_PAGE`. Localization locales must match the app's configured locales (e.g. `tr`, not `tr-TR`).

### Custom Product Pages

```bash
# List and inspect
ascelerate product-pages list <bundle-id>
ascelerate product-pages info <bundle-id> <name-or-id>

# Create — the API requires a first version + localization, so --locale is required
ascelerate product-pages create <bundle-id> --name "Summer Campaign" --locale en-US --promotional-text "Limited-time offer"

# Rename or toggle App Store visibility
ascelerate product-pages update <bundle-id> "Summer Campaign" --name "Summer 2026" --visible false
ascelerate product-pages delete <bundle-id> "Summer Campaign"

# Localizations (promotional text per locale)
ascelerate product-pages localizations view <bundle-id> "Summer 2026"
ascelerate product-pages localizations export <bundle-id> "Summer 2026"
ascelerate product-pages localizations import <bundle-id> "Summer 2026" --file page-locales.json

# Screenshots & app previews (sets created on first upload)
ascelerate product-pages media list <bundle-id> "Summer 2026"
ascelerate product-pages media upload <bundle-id> "Summer 2026" --locale en-US --display-type APP_IPHONE_67 screenshot.png
ascelerate product-pages media upload <bundle-id> "Summer 2026" --locale en-US --preview-type APP_IPHONE_67 preview.mp4 --preview-frame 00:00:03
ascelerate product-pages media delete <bundle-id> "Summer 2026" <media-id>
```

Pages are referenced by name or ID. Each page's shareable App Store URL (with its `ppid`) appears in `list` and `info`.

### Reports

Download Sales & Trends, Financial, and App Analytics reports. Sales/Finance reports come back as Apple's gzipped TSV — ascelerate decompresses and summarizes them (or saves the raw file with `--output`/`--raw`).

```bash
# Sales & Trends — units/downloads, proceeds, IAP/subscription activity
ascelerate reports sales                                    # most recent day, all apps
ascelerate reports sales --frequency WEEKLY
ascelerate reports sales --frequency MONTHLY --date 2026-05
ascelerate reports sales --frequency YEARLY --date 2025 --bundle-id com.example.App
ascelerate reports sales --frequency DAILY --date 2026-06-20 --output sales.tsv

# Financial report — units + partner proceeds for a fiscal period, by region
ascelerate reports finance --date 2026-05 --region US
ascelerate reports finance --date 2026-05 --region US --type FINANCE_DETAIL --output finance.tsv

# App Analytics — downloads, impressions, sessions (async: creates/reuses a report request)
ascelerate reports analytics <bundle-id>
ascelerate reports analytics <bundle-id> --category APP_USAGE --granularity WEEKLY
```

- `reports sales` / `reports finance` need a **vendor number** (App Store Connect → Payments and Financial Reports). Save it with `configure` or pass `--vendor-number`.
- The sales summary groups units by app and **product type identifier**, distinguishing first-time downloads (`1*`/`3*`) from updates (`7*`) and in-app purchases (`IA*`). Use `--raw` for the full TSV.
- Apple generates analytics reports asynchronously — a freshly created snapshot isn't ready immediately; re-run the command after a few minutes to download the segments.
- The API does not expose aggregate rating counts or the star-rating average — only individual reviews (see Customer Reviews).

### Rate Limit

Check your current API usage against the rolling hourly quota:

```bash
ascelerate rate-limit
```

```
Hourly limit: 3600 requests (rolling window)
Used:         57
Remaining:    3543 (98%)
```

### Workflows

Chain multiple commands into a single automated run with a workflow file:

```bash
ascelerate run-workflow release.txt
ascelerate run-workflow release.txt --yes   # skip all prompts (CI/CD)
ascelerate run-workflow                     # interactively select from .workflow/.txt files
```

A workflow file is a plain text file with one command per line (without the `ascelerate` prefix). Lines starting with `#` are comments, blank lines are ignored. Both `.workflow` and `.txt` extensions are supported.

**Example** -- `release.txt` for submitting version 2.1.0 of a sample app:

```
# Release workflow for MyApp v2.1.0

# Create the new version on App Store Connect
apps create-version com.example.MyApp 2.1.0

# Build, validate, and upload
builds archive --scheme MyApp
builds validate --latest --bundle-id com.example.MyApp
builds upload --latest --bundle-id com.example.MyApp

# Wait for the build to finish processing
builds await-processing com.example.MyApp

# Update localizations and attach the build
apps localizations import com.example.MyApp --file localizations.json
apps build attach-latest com.example.MyApp

# Submit for review
apps review submit com.example.MyApp
```

Without `--yes`, the workflow asks for confirmation before starting, and individual commands still prompt where they normally would (e.g., before submitting for review). With `--yes`, all prompts are skipped for fully unattended execution.

### Automation

Most commands that prompt for confirmation support `--yes` / `-y` to skip prompts, making them suitable for CI/CD pipelines and scripts. When using `--yes` with provisioning commands, all required arguments must be provided explicitly (interactive mode is disabled):

```bash
ascelerate apps build attach-latest <bundle-id> --yes
ascelerate apps review submit <bundle-id> --yes
```

On universal-purchase apps, also pass `--platform` so unattended runs never hit the interactive platform-disambiguation prompt.

### Version

```bash
ascelerate version     # Prints version number
ascelerate --version   # Same as above
ascelerate -v          # Same as above
```
