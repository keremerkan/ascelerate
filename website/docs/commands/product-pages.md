# Custom Product Pages

Create and manage custom product pages — alternate versions of your App Store product page with their own promotional text and screenshots, each reachable via a unique URL. Pages are referenced by **name** or ID.

## List & inspect

```bash
ascelerate product-pages list <bundle-id>
ascelerate product-pages info <bundle-id> <name-or-id>
```

`list` shows each page's name, visibility, shareable App Store URL (including its `ppid`), and ID. `info` adds the page's versions and their localizations.

## Create

```bash
ascelerate product-pages create <bundle-id> --name "Summer Campaign" --locale en-US --promotional-text "Limited-time offer"
```

The App Store Connect API requires a page to be created together with a first version and at least one localization, so `--locale` is required. Add more locales afterward with `product-pages localizations import`.

## Update & delete

```bash
ascelerate product-pages update <bundle-id> "Summer Campaign" --name "Summer 2026" --visible false
ascelerate product-pages delete <bundle-id> "Summer Campaign"
```

`--visible` toggles whether the page is live on the App Store.

## Localizations

```bash
ascelerate product-pages localizations view <bundle-id> "Summer 2026"
ascelerate product-pages localizations export <bundle-id> "Summer 2026"
ascelerate product-pages localizations import <bundle-id> "Summer 2026" --file page-locales.json
```

Each localization carries `promotionalText`, applied to the page's editable version.

```json
{
  "en-US": { "promotionalText": "Limited-time offer" },
  "fr-FR": { "promotionalText": "Offre à durée limitée" }
}
```

## Screenshots & app previews

Per-locale screenshots (`.png`/`.jpg`, by display type) and app previews (`.mp4`/`.mov`, by preview type). The set is created automatically on first upload.

```bash
ascelerate product-pages media list <bundle-id> "Summer 2026"
ascelerate product-pages media upload <bundle-id> "Summer 2026" --locale en-US --display-type APP_IPHONE_67 screenshot.png
ascelerate product-pages media upload <bundle-id> "Summer 2026" --locale en-US --preview-type APP_IPHONE_67 preview.mp4 --preview-frame 00:00:03
ascelerate product-pages media delete <bundle-id> "Summer 2026" <media-id>
```

The file type determines whether it's uploaded as a screenshot or an app preview. Display and preview types use the standard App Store device identifiers (e.g. `APP_IPHONE_67`, `APP_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129`).

`--display-type` also takes the asset library slots `PRODUCT_PAGE_HEADER` and `APP_STORE_SEARCH_RESULTS` (an image or video that replaces the current one) and `APP_IPHONE_DUO` (a screenshot or app preview, added after the existing ones); [Media](media.md#header-and-search-results) lists their sizes. `media list` shows them, and `media delete` removes them by ID.
