# Subscriptions

## List and inspect

```bash
ascelerate sub groups <bundle-id>
ascelerate sub list <bundle-id>
ascelerate sub info <bundle-id> <product-id>
```

All three accept `--json` for machine-readable output ([conventions](../guides/automation.md#json-output)); `info` reports the missing-prices warning as a `hasPricing` boolean.

## Create, update, and delete subscriptions

```bash
ascelerate sub create <bundle-id> --name "Monthly" --product-id <product-id> --period ONE_MONTH --group-id <group-id>
ascelerate sub update <bundle-id> <product-id> --name "Monthly Plan"
ascelerate sub delete <bundle-id> <product-id>
```

## Subscription groups

```bash
ascelerate sub create-group <bundle-id> --name "Premium"
ascelerate sub update-group <bundle-id> --name "Premium Plus"
ascelerate sub delete-group <bundle-id>
```

## Submit for review

```bash
ascelerate sub submit <bundle-id> <product-id>
```

A product can be submitted whenever it has a pending version: any version in Prepare for Submission, Ready for Review, or a rejected state. This includes approved products with edits since their last approval. Without a pending version the command stops before making any request. `sub info` shows the pending version when there is one.

## Subscription localizations

```bash
ascelerate sub localizations view <bundle-id> <product-id>
ascelerate sub localizations export <bundle-id> <product-id>
ascelerate sub localizations import <bundle-id> <product-id> --file sub-de.json
```

## Group localizations

```bash
ascelerate sub group-localizations view <bundle-id>
ascelerate sub group-localizations export <bundle-id>
ascelerate sub group-localizations import <bundle-id> --file group-de.json
```

The import commands create missing locales automatically with confirmation, so you can add new languages without visiting App Store Connect.

## Pricing

Subscription pricing is per-territory. There is no auto-equalize concept like IAPs have — every territory you want to price needs its own record. The CLI either sets a single territory or fans the price out across all territories using Apple's local-currency tier equivalents.

```bash
# Show current per-territory prices (warns if none)
ascelerate sub pricing show <bundle-id> <product-id>

# Show them as JSON (price, currency, start date, and preserved flag per territory)
ascelerate sub pricing show <bundle-id> <product-id> --json

# List available tiers for a territory
ascelerate sub pricing tiers <bundle-id> <product-id> --territory USA

# Set the price for a single territory
ascelerate sub pricing set <bundle-id> <product-id> --price 4.99 --territory USA

# Fan out a price across all territories (one POST per territory)
ascelerate sub pricing set <bundle-id> <product-id> --price 4.99 --equalize-all-territories
```

### Price changes and existing subscribers

Apple treats price changes differently for existing subscribers depending on the direction. `sub pricing set` fetches the current price for each affected territory, classifies the change, and enforces the right behavior:

- **Decrease**: existing subscribers automatically move to the lower price. Interactive runs prompt with a warning. In `--yes` mode, you must add `--confirm-decrease` to acknowledge the revenue impact — plain `--yes` is not enough.
- **Increase**: you must explicitly choose how to handle existing subscribers. The command errors unless one of the following is set:
  - `--preserve-current` — grandfather existing subscribers at their old price
  - `--no-preserve-current` — push the new price to existing subscribers (after Apple's notification period)
- **New territory** (no existing price): no existing subscribers; flags optional.
- **Unchanged**: skipped silently.

The same rules apply aggregated across `--equalize-all-territories`. If any territory in the fan-out is an increase, the preserve flag is required for all of them. If any is a decrease in `--yes` mode, `--confirm-decrease` is required.

```bash
# Standard global price raise: $4.99 → $9.99 across all territories,
# grandfather existing subscribers at the old price
ascelerate sub pricing set myapp com.example.monthly \
  --price 9.99 --territory USA --equalize-all-territories \
  --preserve-current
```

### Copy prices between products

```bash
# Export every territory's current price to JSON
ascelerate sub pricing export <bundle-id> <product-id> --output prices.json

# Apply it to another subscription — in the same app or a different one
ascelerate sub pricing import <other-bundle-id> <other-product-id> --file prices.json
```

The file stores customer prices keyed by territory code (preserved/grandfathered and future-scheduled prices are excluded from the export). On import, each price is matched against the *target* subscription's own tiers by customer price, so the same file works across products and apps. Import only touches territories listed in the file, skips ones already at the listed price, and enforces the same increase/decrease safety rules as `set` — including `--preserve-current`/`--no-preserve-current` and `--confirm-decrease`.

Transient App Store Connect errors (HTTP 429/5xx) during multi-territory writes are retried automatically — first in place with backoff, then in a second sweep at the end of the run. Territories that still fail are listed in the final report and the command exits non-zero; re-running the same command retries just those, since already-updated territories are skipped as unchanged.

## Availability

Each subscription has its own territory availability, independent of the app's. By default a subscription inherits its app's territories; once you call `sub availability` with changes, the subscription has an explicit list.

```bash
# View current per-subscription territories
ascelerate sub availability <bundle-id> <product-id>

# Edit the territory list (wholesale POST replaces the full list)
ascelerate sub availability <bundle-id> <product-id> --add CHN,RUS
ascelerate sub availability <bundle-id> <product-id> --remove ITA
ascelerate sub availability <bundle-id> <product-id> --available-in-new-territories true
```

## Introductory offers

Introductory offers target **new subscribers** — free trials and intro discounts.

```bash
ascelerate sub intro-offer list <bundle-id> <product-id>

# Free trial (no price needed; --periods + --duration set the trial length)
ascelerate sub intro-offer create <bundle-id> <product-id> \
  --mode FREE_TRIAL --duration ONE_WEEK --periods 1

# Pay-as-you-go discount (3 months at $0.99/mo, scoped to USA)
ascelerate sub intro-offer create <bundle-id> <product-id> \
  --mode PAY_AS_YOU_GO --duration ONE_MONTH --periods 3 \
  --territory USA --price 0.99

# Update only the end date (other fields require delete + recreate)
ascelerate sub intro-offer update <bundle-id> <product-id> <offer-id> --end-date 2026-12-31

ascelerate sub intro-offer delete <bundle-id> <product-id> <offer-id>
```

Modes: `FREE_TRIAL`, `PAY_AS_YOU_GO`, `PAY_UP_FRONT`. Without `--territory`, the offer applies globally; with `--territory`, it's scoped to that one territory. `--price` is required for the two paid modes and forbidden for `FREE_TRIAL`.

## Promotional offers

Promotional offers target **existing subscribers** — typically used for in-app upsell flows. The offer code (the `--code` value) must be embedded in a signed payload your server generates at runtime before clients can redeem it.

```bash
ascelerate sub promo-offer list <bundle-id> <product-id>
ascelerate sub promo-offer info <bundle-id> <product-id> <offer-id>

# Create — same single-territory or --equalize-all-territories pattern
ascelerate sub promo-offer create <bundle-id> <product-id> \
  --name "Loyalty 50%" --code LOYALTY50 \
  --mode PAY_AS_YOU_GO --duration ONE_MONTH --periods 3 \
  --price 4.99 --territory USA --equalize-all-territories

# Update only prices (other fields require delete + recreate)
ascelerate sub promo-offer update <bundle-id> <product-id> <offer-id> \
  --price 5.99 --equalize-all-territories

ascelerate sub promo-offer delete <bundle-id> <product-id> <offer-id>
```

## Offer codes

Offer codes are redeemable codes for subscriptions, with two flavors:

- **One-time-use codes**: Apple generates N unique codes in a batch (asynchronously). Each can only be redeemed once.
- **Custom codes**: developer-supplied string redeemable N times.

```bash
ascelerate sub offer-code list <bundle-id> <product-id>
ascelerate sub offer-code info <bundle-id> <product-id> <offer-code-id>

# Create an offer code (with all the offer-style attributes)
ascelerate sub offer-code create <bundle-id> <product-id> \
  --name "Launch Free Month" \
  --eligibility NEW \
  --offer-eligibility STACK_WITH_INTRO_OFFERS \
  --mode FREE_TRIAL --duration ONE_MONTH --periods 1 \
  --price 0 --territory USA --equalize-all-territories

ascelerate sub offer-code toggle <bundle-id> <product-id> <offer-code-id> --active true

# Generate one-time-use codes (async)
ascelerate sub offer-code gen-codes <bundle-id> <product-id> <offer-code-id> \
  --count 500 --expires 2026-12-31

# Fetch the actual code values once generation completes
ascelerate sub offer-code view-codes <one-time-use-batch-id> --output codes.txt

# Add a developer-supplied custom code
ascelerate sub offer-code add-custom-codes <bundle-id> <product-id> <offer-code-id> \
  --code SUBPROMO --count 1000 --expires 2026-12-31
```

Customer eligibilities for subscription offer codes: `NEW`, `EXISTING`, `EXPIRED`. Offer eligibility: `STACK_WITH_INTRO_OFFERS` or `REPLACE_INTRO_OFFERS`.

## Submit subscription group for review

Subscription groups are reviewed alongside the next app version. `sub submit-group` is the group-level mirror of `sub submit`.

```bash
ascelerate sub submit-group <bundle-id>
```

The group needs a pending version of its own (for example edited group localizations); otherwise the command stops before making any request.

## Promotional images

Upload promotional artwork shown alongside the subscription in the App Store.

```bash
ascelerate sub images list <bundle-id> <product-id>
ascelerate sub images upload <bundle-id> <product-id> ./hero.png
ascelerate sub images delete <bundle-id> <product-id> <image-id>
```

## App Review screenshot

Each subscription can have at most one App Review screenshot. Uploading replaces any existing one.

```bash
ascelerate sub review-screenshot view <bundle-id> <product-id>
ascelerate sub review-screenshot upload <bundle-id> <product-id> ./review.png
ascelerate sub review-screenshot delete <bundle-id> <product-id>
```

Image and screenshot uploads use Apple's 3-step file upload flow (reserve → PUT chunks → commit with MD5). The CLI handles all three steps in a single `upload` call.

## Win-back offers (not yet implemented)

Win-back offers (offers for churned subscribers) are intentionally not implemented yet. The `WinBackOfferPriceInlineCreate` type in our `asc-swift` dependency is missing the `territory` and `subscriptionPricePoint` relationships the API requires, so we can't construct a valid create request. Will revisit once the upstream library is updated.
