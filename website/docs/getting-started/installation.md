# Installation

## Requirements

- macOS 13+
- Swift 6.0+ (only for building from source)

## Homebrew

```bash
brew tap keremerkan/tap
brew trust keremerkan/tap
brew install ascelerate
```

The tap provides a pre-built binary for Apple Silicon Macs, so installation is instant.

:::note
Since Homebrew 6.0, third-party taps must be explicitly trusted before their code runs. The `brew trust` step above approves the tap. Alternatively, a fully-qualified install (`brew install keremerkan/tap/ascelerate`) prompts you to trust it interactively.
:::

## Install script

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keremerkan/ascelerate/main/install.sh | bash
```

Downloads the latest release, installs to `/usr/local/bin`, and removes the quarantine attribute automatically. Apple Silicon only.

## Download manually

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/keremerkan/ascelerate/releases):

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/keremerkan/ascelerate/releases/latest/download/ascelerate-macos-arm64.tar.gz -o ascelerate.tar.gz
tar xzf ascelerate.tar.gz
mv ascelerate /usr/local/bin/
```

Since the binary is not signed or notarized, macOS will quarantine it on first download. Remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/ascelerate
```

:::note
Pre-built binaries are provided for Apple Silicon (arm64) only. Intel Mac users should build from source.
:::

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keremerkan/ascelerate.git
cd ascelerate
swift build -c release
strip .build/release/ascelerate
cp .build/release/ascelerate /usr/local/bin/
```

:::note
The release build takes several minutes because it compiles the App Store Connect client that ascelerate generates from Apple's OpenAPI specification. `strip` removes debug symbols, reducing the binary from ~156 MB to ~41 MB.
:::

## Shell completions

Set up tab completion for subcommands, options, and flags (supports zsh and bash):

```bash
ascelerate install-completions
```

This detects your shell and configures everything automatically. Restart your shell or open a new tab to activate.

## AI coding skill (optional)

If you use an AI coding agent like Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or GitHub Copilot, you can install a skill file that gives it full knowledge of all ascelerate commands and workflows:

```bash
ascelerate install-skill    # detected agents (Claude Code/Cursor/Windsurf; +Copilot with --all)
npx ascelerate-skill        # any AI coding agent (no CLI needed)
```

See the [AI Coding Skill](/docs/guides/ai-skill) guide for details.

## Check your version

```bash
ascelerate version     # Prints version number
ascelerate --version   # Same as above
ascelerate -v          # Same as above
```
